# Easy Open Journal
The public repo for the source code of Easy Open Journal.

Easy Open Journal is a fullstack web application made with Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB. <br>
The journal is simple by design. All users can see all journal posts and may compose new entries at will.<br> 
New entries are filtered for profanity before being saved to a persistent MongoDB Atlas connection. <br>  

The MongoDB connection URL has been obfuscated for this repo.<br>
To run this repo locally you need to clone it, npm install, and then change the connection URL to your own Atlas or localhost connection.
